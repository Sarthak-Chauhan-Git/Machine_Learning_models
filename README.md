# Basic Machine learning projects

A. ðŸ“ˆ Stock Market Prediction using Machine Learning
This project uses supervised learning techniques to predict stock market trends based on historical data. Key features like moving averages, volatility indicators, and momentum factors are extracted to train regression models such as Linear Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost. Performance is evaluated using MSE, RMSE, and RÂ² Score.
Goal: Assist in forecasting future stock prices to support data-driven trading decisions.

B. ðŸŽµ Music Genre Classification
This project classifies music tracks into genres using machine learning. Leveraging datasets with audio features like tempo, spectral contrast, MFCCs, and chroma features, models such as KNN, SVM, and Random Forest are trained and evaluated.
Goal: Automatically identify a songâ€™s genre to improve recommendations and content organization in music apps.

C. ðŸ’¬ Sentiment Analysis on Text Data
This project focuses on classifying the sentiment (positive, negative, or neutral) of user-generated text like tweets or reviews. It uses NLP techniques like tokenization, TF-IDF vectorization, and pre-processing pipelines, followed by models such as Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, and SVM.
Goal: Extract sentiment insights from text data to aid in brand monitoring, customer feedback analysis, and opinion mining.
